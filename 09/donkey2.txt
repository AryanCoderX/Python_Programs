The donkey wandered into the farmer’s field, trampling over the freshly planted crops. The farmer, who was already frustrated with the donkey’s stubbornness, grabbed a stick and chased it away. Meanwhile, the mischievous brat from the village laughed at the scene, finding amusement in the farmer’s struggle. His foolish dog, instead of helping, started barking at the cows, causing a commotion. The farmer sighed, thinking about the idiot trader who had sold him such an unruly beast. He muttered under his breath, “What a stupid day this has been!” As he tried to get back to work, he saw the lazy farmhand leaning against a tree, chewing on a piece of straw instead of helping. "You clown, get back to work!" the farmer yelled. The farmhand simply shrugged, unwilling to put in more effort.
