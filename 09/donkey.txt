The ###### was wandering through the village when another ###### approached it, carrying a heavy load of hay. The first ###### brayed loudly, seemingly greeting the second ######, which simply nodded in return. As they walked together, a farmer spotted them and decided to use the stronger ###### to pull his cart. The stubborn ######, however, refused to move, causing the farmer to sigh. "A ###### can be useful, but only if it listens!" he muttered, watching the other ###### munch on some grass lazily.
