# Python Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains all the Python programs I wrote while learning Python from the [Code with Harry](https://www.codewithharry.com/) course on YouTube.

## 📚 About

This collection includes beginner to intermediate level Python scripts that I wrote as I progressed through the tutorials. The topics covered include:

- Basic syntax and variables
- Conditional statements
- Loops (for and while)
- Functions
- Data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling
- Modules and packages
- Exception handling
- And more...

Each script reflects a concept or a project I practiced during the course.

## 🔍 Folder Structure

The programs are organized by topic or lesson (if applicable), with filenames that describe the content or purpose of the code.

## 🎯 Goal

This repo is mainly for personal reference and revision, but anyone starting with Python and following Code with Harry’s tutorials can also use it as a guide or comparison.

## 📌 Note

- All code is written using Python 3.
- Some files may contain comments to help with understanding.
- This is not a polished project, but rather a learning archive.
